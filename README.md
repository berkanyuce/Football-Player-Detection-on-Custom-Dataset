# Custom Training for Football Players
Hi! This is my custom training project using Roboflow and YOLOv7. I added the resulting video, the roboflow link, and the notebook.

# Dataset
I took 262 screenshots from match highlights videos on Youtube. And then I labeled only players as "player".
# Conclusion
Even though I labeled only players, the results show that sometimes the referee is labeled as a player. To fix this problem, I will do this training by adding more photos and separating the humans on the field as team1, team2, goalkeeper, and referee.
